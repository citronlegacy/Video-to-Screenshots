### Project Description

This Google Colab notebook is a project for generating frames from a video. It can take a video file as input and output a screenshot every frame or every n frames.
I recommend not outputting every frame as it would generate thousands of images for even a few minutes of video.

### Libraries Used

- **FFmpeg:** A multimedia framework for handling audio, video, and other multimedia files.
- **tqdm:** A library for displaying progress bars in Python.
- **subprocess:** A module to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
- **shlex:** A module for parsing strings into tokens, especially useful when dealing with command-line-like syntax.
- **os:** A module for interacting with the operating system, providing functionality to manage directories and files.
- **ipywidgets:** A library for creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks.
